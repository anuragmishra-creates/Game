## 📖 How to Play

Snake and Ladder is a simple board game traditionally played between 2 or more players. The goal is to race your token from square **1 to 100**. On your turn, roll the dice and move forward the number of spaces shown.

- 🎯 **Land on a ladder?** You'll instantly climb to the top of it.
- 🐍 **Land on a snake?** It'll slide you down to its tail.
- ✅ First to reach square **100** wins!

## 🧩 Game Features

This version of Snake & Ladder includes several gameplay and visual enhancements:

- 🎨 **Board Selection**  
  Choose from multiple beautifully designed boards (while not fully customizable, each offers a distinct visual style).

- ⚙️ **Game Modes**  
  Every board can be played in one of three unique modes:

  - ✅ **Classic Mode:** Snakes pull you down, ladders lift you up — the traditional way!
  - 🌀 **Reversed Mode:** Snakes help you climb up from their tails, while ladders trip you down to the bottom!
  - ❓ **Mixed Mode:** Snakes and ladders randomly switch behaviors during the game — with alerts to keep you on your toes!

- ⚙️ **Opponent Type**  
  Every board can be played in one of two ways:

  - **👤Player Vs Computer💻**
  - **👤Player Vs Player👤**
  
- 🎲 **Forced Dice Rolls**  
  Enable this fun mode to **manually set dice values** for each player. Great for testing, playful cheating, or reliving that childhood dream of always rolling sixes!
