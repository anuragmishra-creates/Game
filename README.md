## Last Updated: 19 June 2025

Welcome to a feature-rich, fun-packed digital version of the timeless board game: **Snake and Ladder**! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game blends nostalgic gameplay with some surprising twists — all in your browser.

## 📖 How to Play

Snake and Ladder is a simple board game traditionally played between 2 or more players. The goal is to race your token from square **1 to 100**. On your turn, roll the dice and move forward the number of spaces shown.

- 🎯 **Land on a ladder?** You'll instantly climb to the top of it.
- 🐍 **Land on a snake?** It'll slide you down to its tail.
- ✅ First to reach square **100** wins!

## 🧩 Game Features

This version of Snake & Ladder includes several gameplay and visual enhancements:

- 🎨 **Board Selection**  
  Choose from multiple beautifully designed boards (while not fully customizable, each offers a distinct visual style). A sleek board preview shows each of the chosen boards elegantly.

- ⚙️ **Game Modes**  
  Every board can be played in one of three unique modes:

  - ✅ **Classic Mode:** Snakes pull you down, ladders lift you up — the traditional way!  
  - 🌀 **Reversed Mode:** Snakes help you climb up from their tails, while ladders trip you down to the bottom!  
  - ❓ **Mixed Mode:** Snakes and ladders randomly switch behaviors during the game — with alerts to keep you on your toes! You can also control the **reversal probability** from the settings panel, which determines how likely the state is to flip after each dice roll.

- ⚙️ **Opponent Type**  
  Every board can be played in one of two ways:  
  - **👤 Player Vs Computer 💻**  
  - **👤 Player Vs Player 👤**

- 🎲 **Forced Dice Rolls**  
  Enable this fun mode to **manually set dice values** for each player. Great for testing, playful cheating, or reliving that childhood dream of always rolling sixes!

- 💾 **Save, Load & Clear**  
  Save your game's progress to your browser’s local storage and load it later to continue playing. You’ll find **Save**, **Load**, and **Clear** buttons in the top-right Settings panel.

- 📊 **Token Statistics**  
  Each token displays a detailed stats box showing the **number of snakes and ladders encountered**, the **total dice sum**, and the **last dice roll** — updated live as the game progresses.

- 🏆 **Winner Board**  
  At the end of each game, a final **Winner Board** presents the winner along with a side-by-side comparison of both tokens’ stats — a neat summary of how the match played out.

- 🧭 **Game Info Box**  
  A dedicated info panel shows **whose turn it is**, the current **game mode**, whether it’s **Player vs Computer or Player vs Player**, and the **current board state** (normal or reversed) — especially helpful in **Mixed Mode**, where the state can change unpredictably.
